      %h1 REFERRED CLOUDSPOKES MEMBERS
    %p Here are the CloudSpokes members that you have personally referred. Every time that someone you referred wins money, so will you! During their first year, youâ€™ll earn 10% of all money that your friends win competing in CloudSpokes challenges. So if a friend wins $1000 in a coding challenge, weâ€™ll give you an additional $100.
