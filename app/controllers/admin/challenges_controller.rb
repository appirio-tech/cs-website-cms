    # create the folder for this challenge
    # QUESTION: How to name the challenge folder? Since this is a new challenge,
    # we still do not have a challenge id. There are a few approaches we can take:
    # - look up the challenges api and use the last challenge id + 1; however
    #   this method is prone to race conditions (when two challenge creators try
    #   to create a challenge at the same time). It becomes too complicated to
    #   create mutexes for this scenario
    # - generate a unique hash. This gives us the benefit of a very low probabilty
    #   of a folder clash happening; however the bucket is not human readable
    #   anymore (you can't look at a folder and immediately tell that it belongs
    #   to a particular challenge)
    # - use a two-step process where a challenge HAS to be created first (and thus
    #   a challenge id is already assigned), then create a folder and upload to
    #   it. This I think is the best approach. I am leaving the uploader at the
    #   first step for now as a proof of concept; once the API endpoint for saving
    #   (and retrieving the challenge id assigned) is up, we can move this to
    #   the second step.
    
    # for now, let's just use the form's authenticity token as the folder name
    folder = params[:authenticity_token]

    # If we're hosting this on heroku, then we might run into timeout problems.
    # We should look into uploading to S3 directly, or spinning off a small server
    # to handle file uploads. This server can also be used for the submission
    # deliverables (e.g. large videos or files).
    file = storage.files.create(
      key: [folder, params[:name]].join('/'),
      body: params[:file].read,
      :public => true

    # create the file in this folder
