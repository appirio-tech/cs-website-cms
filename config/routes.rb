  # This means, any requests to the root URL of your application will go to Refinery::PagesController#home.
  # If you would like to change where this extension is mounted, simply change the :at option to something different.
  #
  # We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Refinery relies on it being the default of "refinery"
